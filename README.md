MyCompresser and MyExtractor

This is a project i did in my 3rd semester here , at NIT Trichy.
It simulates a situation, where a shopkeeper needs to send everyday, the orders received(on books), to his senior official(say, manager).
The "MyCompressor" code helps him compress a huge datafile and send it (The Program has been designed to store ~200 data sets).
The "MyExtractor" code is used by the manager, to extract the information received.



MyCompressor : 

This code reads the given input, and creates a huffman tree, using the traditional Huffman Algorithm.
Inorder to retreive the information, one not only needs the huffman code, but also the huffman tree.
The huffman code and the tree are stored in two separate .txt files.
This program has domeits job of compression and can now be closed.
The two files generated by the program are now ready to be sent.
Comments are plaed all over the program to assist you in understanding the code.


MyExtractor :

This code extracts the information received using the two files.
The logic is trivial, and the code is self-explanatory.



NOTE : IF YOU WISH TO EXECUTE IT ON YOUR SYSTEM, PLEASE CREATE THE DIRECTORY(MyZip) IN YOUR SYSTEM BY STRICTLY FOLLOWING              THE PATH.
AALTERNATIVELY, YOU CAN EDIT THE PROGRAM TO HAVE YOUR OWN PATH.
